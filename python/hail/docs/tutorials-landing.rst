To take Hail for a test drive, go through our tutorials. These can be viewed here in the documentation,
but we recommend instead that you run them yourself with Jupyter.

Download the Hail distribution from our  :ref:`getting started <sec-getting_started>`. Inside, you'll find
a ``tutorials/`` directory. ``cd`` to this directory and run ``sh hail-jupyter.sh`` to get start the notebook
server, then click one of the notebooks to begin!
