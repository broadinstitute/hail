Hail 2 Tutorials
================

To take Hail for a test drive, go through our tutorials. These can be viewed here in the documentation,
but we recommend instead that you run them yourself with Jupyter.

Download the Hail distribution from our :ref:`getting started page<sec-getting_started>`, and follow
the instructions there to set up the Hail. Inside the unzipped distribution folder, you'll find
a ``tutorials/`` directory. ``cd`` to this directory and run ``jhail`` to start the notebook
server, then click a notebook to begin!

Hail Overview
=============

This notebook is designed to provide a broad overview of Hailâ€™s functionality, with emphasis on the
functionality to manipulate and query a genetic dataset. We walk through a genome-wide SNP association
test, and demonstrate the need to control for confounding caused by population stratification.
