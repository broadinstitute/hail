The [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/about-us) was launched in 2004 to improve human health by using genomics to advance our understanding of the biology and treatment of human disease, and to help lay the groundwork for a new generation of therapies.

The Hail team's mission is to build tools to enable rapid analysis and exploration of massive genetic datasets (100s of TB and tripling yearly). We are committed to open science and everything we do is open source. We currently develop in Scala, Spark, Python and C/C++ but will use any tools we need to get the job done.
