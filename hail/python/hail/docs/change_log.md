# Change Log


## 0.2.5 

Released 2018-12-07

### New features

 - (hail#4845) The [or_error](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/functions/core.html#hail.expr.builders.CaseBuilder.or_error) method in `hl.case` and `hl.switch` statements now takes a string expression rather than a string literal, allowing more informative messages for errors and assertions.
 - (hail#4865) We use this new `or_error` functionality in methods that require biallelic variants to include an offending variant in the error message.
 - (hail#4820) Added [hl.reversed](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/functions/collections.html?highlight=reversed#hail.expr.functions.reversed) for reversing arrays and strings.
 - (hail#4895) Added `include_strand` option to the [hl.liftover](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/functions/genetics.html?highlight=liftover#hail.expr.functions.liftover) function.


### Performance improvements
 
 - (hail#4907)(hail#4911) Addressed one aspect of bad scaling in enormous literal values (triggered by a list of 300,000 sample IDs) related to logging.
 - (hail#4909)(hail#4914) Fixed a check in Table/MatrixTable initialization that scaled O(n^2) with the total number of fields.

### Bug fixes

 - (hail#4754)(hail#4799) Fixed optimizer assertion errors related to certain types of pipelines using ``group_rows_by``.
 - (hail#4888) Fixed assertion error in BlockMatrix.sum.
 - (hail#4871) Fixed possible error in locally sorting nested collections.
 - (hail#4889) Fixed break in compatibility with extremely old MatrixTable/Table files.
 - (hail#4527)(hail#4761) Fixed optimizer assertion error sometimes encountered with ``hl.split_multi[_hts]``.
