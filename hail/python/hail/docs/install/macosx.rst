========================
Install Hail on Mac OS X
========================

- Install `Java 8 <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html>`__.
- Install Python 3.6 or 3.7. We recommend `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macosx-installers>`__; however, the latest version of Miniconda installs Python 3.8 by default. Please follow `these instructions <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands>`__ to create a Python 3.6 or 3.7 environment.
- Open Terminal.app and execute ``pip install hail``.
- `Run your first Hail query! <try.rst>`__
