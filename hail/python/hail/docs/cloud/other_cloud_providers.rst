Other Cloud Providers

Amazon Web Services
-------------------

While Hail does not have any built-in tools for working with
`Amazon EMR <https://aws.amazon.com/emr/>`__, we recommend the `open-source
tool <https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances>`__ developed by Carlos De Niz
with the `Avillach Lab <https://avillach-lab.hms.harvard.edu/>`_ at Harvard Medical School

Others
------

There are no known open-source resources for working with Hail on cloud
providers other than Google and AWS. If you know of one, please submit a pull
request to add it here!

If you have scripts for working with Hail on other cloud providers, we may be
interested in including those scripts in ``hailctl`` (see above) as new
modules. Stop by the `dev forum <https://dev.hail.is>`__ to chat!
