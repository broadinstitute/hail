### Concise and visual description of the big opportunity

You/Cotton have done this a million times other places, but it goes something like

"There is a tidal wave of genomic data coming, there is an urgent need to handle it, and our tools aren't ready. Hail is a pioneering team that is already making an outsized impact on the future of biomedical research, and we need your help." 

#### Insert: Chart from Cotton's Spark presentation
 
Or something similar showing future size of genomics data as compared with today's structured big datasets like YouTube, Facebook, etc. with short description of the magnitude of the challenge that poses

### Vision for Hail

The vision for Hail is an open source platform that can quickly and affordably compute on petabytes of data, and help accelerate scientists' efforts at finding cures for disease. We are excited by the strides we have made toward this goal over the last two years, but we are just getting started.

#### INSERT: high-level, not too technical, exciting description of what Hail has achieved for science so far, citation list with links

### One or two sentences on next steps

Articulate in broad strokes what this engineer will be working on to take Hail to the next level, so he/she can begin to imagine how his/her skills will apply.

### Paragraph on why working at the Broad is special.

Close contact with scientists, startup within a larger community, connections to the forefront of medical research worldwide, etc.  You are trying to appeal to the engineer who is searching for a more meaningful life beyond ad clicks, and briefly painting a picture of what his/her life at the Broad would feel like.

He/she should literally imagine him/herself in front of the chalkboard
