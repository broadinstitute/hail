[Hail](https://hail.is) is an open-source framework for scalable genetic data analysis.

To get started using Hail:

- read the docs ([Getting Started](https://hail.is/getting_started.html), [Overview](https://hail.is/overview.html), [Tutorial](https://hail.is/tutorial.html), [General Reference](https://hail.is/reference.html), [Command Reference](https://hail.is/commands.html), [FAQ](https://hail.is/faq.html))
- join the [discussion forum](http://discuss.hail.is)
- chat with the Hail team and other users on [Hail Gitter](https://gitter.im/hail-is/hail)

Hail has a robust software test suite and is used for [research](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/06/050195) and large-scale genetics projects, including [ExACv2](http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) (200k exomes) and gnomAD (20k whole genomes). At the same time, Hail is under very active development as we work toward a stable release, so we do not guarentee forward compatibility of formats and interfaces. If you're interested to get involved in development, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/hail-is/hail) and chat with us in the [Gitter dev room](https://gitter.im/hail-is/hail-dev).

We encourage use of the [discussion forum](http://discuss.hail.is) for user and dev support, feature requests, and sharing your Hail-powered science. Please report any suspected bugs directly to [issues](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues).

The Hail team is based in the [Neale lab](https://nealelab.squarespace.com/) at the [Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research](http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/psychiatric-disease/stanley-center-psychiatric-research/stanle) of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](http://www.broadinstitute.org) and the [Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/) of [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/).
