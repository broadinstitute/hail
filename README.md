# Hail

Hail is a framework for scalable genetic data analysis.  Hail is
pre-alpha software and under active development.  Hail is written in
Scala (mostly) and uses Apache [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and
other Apache Hadoop projects.  If you are interested in getting
involved in Hail development, email hail@broadinstitute.org.
