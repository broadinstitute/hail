Hail is an open-source framework for scalable genetic data analysis. To get started using Hail, see the [documentation](https://hail.is/docs/), join the [discussion forum](http://discuss.hail.is), and chat with the Hail team and other users on the [Hail gitter](https://gitter.im/hail-is/hail).

Hail is pre-alpha software and under active development. If you're interested to get involved, see the [Development category](http://discuss.hail.is/c/development) of the discussion forum and chat with the Hail team and other developers on the [Hail development gitter](https://gitter.im/hail-is/hail-dev).

We encourage use of the discussion forum for user and dev support, feature requests, and sharing your Hail-powered science. Please report any suspected bugs directly to [issues](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues).

The Hail team is based in the Neale lab at the [Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research](http://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/psychiatric-disease/stanley-center-psychiatric-research/stanle) of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](http://www.broadinstitute.org) and the [Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/) of [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://www.massgeneral.org/).

Contact the Hail team at `hail@broadinstitute.org`.
