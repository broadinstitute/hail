    <p>Navigate to the <a href="{{ base_url }}/notebook">Notebook</a>
      tab to create a notebook with workshop materials installed, or
      return to an existing notebook.</p>

    <p><span style="color:red;">Warning:</span> Notebooks are
      ephemeral.  If you close a notebook or log out, any work in the
      notebook will be lost.  To save a notebook, go to File >
      Download as in Jupyter to download it.</p>

    <p>The notebook service is not available outside workshops like
      this, but we (the Hail team) is working hard to change that.</p>
