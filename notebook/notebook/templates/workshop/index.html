      tab to launch Jupyter with workshop materials installed, or
      return to an existing Jupyter instance.</p>

    <p><span style="color:red;">Warning:</span> Notebooks are
      ephemeral.  If you close Jupyter or log out, any work in the
      notebook will be lost.  To download a notebook, use the File >
      Download as menu in Jupyter.</p>

    <p>The notebook service is not currently available outside of
      workshops like this, but we (the Hail team) are working hard to
      change that.</p>
