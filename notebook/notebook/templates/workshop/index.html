      tab to create or revisit a Jupyter notebook with the workshop
      materials installed.</p>

      any notebook you have running and any work in progress
      will be lost.</p>

    <p>The notebook service is not available outside workshops like this, but
      we (the Hail team) is working hard to change that.</p>
